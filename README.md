Rhisis is a FlyForFun V15 emulator built with C# 7 and the .NET Core Framework 1.0.

This project has been created for learning purposes about the network and game logic problematics on the server-side. Also, this is a rework of the Hellion emulator.

We choose to use the [Ether.Network][ethernetwork] because it provides a clients management system and also a robust packet management system entirely customisable.
